**In Short:** We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason.

If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on to process your personal information.

### 5. DO WE OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS?

**In Short:** Yes, we use artificial intelligence technologies for processing user-uploaded images.

We integrate the **AI Portrait model API** provided by the **Replicated platform** to enable AI-based functionalities in our Services. These technologies are designed to process user-uploaded facial images and apply outfit changes in real-time. The terms in this Privacy Notice govern your use of these AI Products within our Services.

#### Use of AI Technologies
- **Data Collected:** The app processes only the facial images voluntarily uploaded by users. No additional biometric data is collected.
- **Purpose of Processing:** User-uploaded images are processed exclusively for generating the requested output using the AI Portrait model.
- **Third-Party Involvement:** The processing is handled via the Replicated platform, which temporarily processes the data in real-time and ensures immediate deletion after the task is completed.

#### How We Process Your Data Using AI
Facial data is **not retained** after processing. All user-provided data is deleted immediately and permanently after the AI model generates the requested output. Neither our application nor the Replicated platform stores or retains this data.

---

### 6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

**In Short:** We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice.

User-provided data, such as facial images, is retained **only during the real-time processing period**. Once the processing is complete, the data is automatically and permanently deleted. We do not store facial images or any other personal data beyond the processing duration.

#### Retention Practices
- **Real-Time Processing:** Temporary storage is necessary to process the image through the AI Portrait model and generate the requested output.
- **Retention Period:** Data is stored only for the duration of processing, typically a few seconds, and deleted immediately afterward.
- **Third Party Involvement:** The processing is handled by the Replicated platform. Replicated does not retain, store, or share any user-provided data.


### 7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

**In Short:** We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
